# Bike-Sharing-Platform
The goal of this project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of a bike sharing app's data collected over a period of 12 months. The dataset consists of multiple CSV files, each containing detailed information about bike rentals, including timestamps, user demographics, rental durations, and geographical locations.

First, I cleaned the data and extracted relevant insights regarding usage patterns, including peak usage hours, days, and months, to understand user behavior and demand fluctuations over time. Then I used geographical data to analyze popular bike rental locations, route preferences, and potential areas for expanding the bike sharing network to optimize user accessibility and convenience.
I then examined user demographics such as age, gender, and user types (e.g., subscribers vs. casual users) to identify target user segments and tailor marketing strategies and service offerings accordingly. I investigated the impact of seasonal variations and weather conditions on bike rental demand to optimize resource allocation, pricing strategies, and promotional activities.

I accessed the overall performance of the bike sharing app, including metrics such as ride duration, frequency of rentals, and customer satisfaction to identify areas for improvement and strategic growth opportunities.

Microsoft Excel and Power Query was used to analyze the dataset;
Microsoft PowerBI was used to create a dashboard that shows a summary of the dataset.

Profered solutions to make the business more profitable:

- Weekend Promotions and Incentives:

Capitalizing on the higher demand for bike rentals on weekends, particularly on Saturdays, by offering special promotions, discounts, or incentives for weekend riders. Also, launching targeted marketing campaigns highlighting weekend-exclusive offers to attract more riders during peak usage times.

- Seasonal Marketing Strategies:

Leverageing the popularity of summer months, especially July, by launching seasonal marketing campaigns promoting outdoor activities and bike rides during the warmer weather. And offer summer-specific promotions, such as discounted summer passes or themed events, to encourage increased usage and attract new riders.

- Docked Bike Expansion and Promotion:

Since docked bikes had the highest rides for both casual and member riders, focus on expanding the availability of docked bike stations in high-demand areas and implementing targeted marketing initiatives to promote the convenience and reliability of docked bikes, emphasizing their accessibility and ease of use for both casual and member riders.

- Member Rider Retention and Engagement:

Recognizing and rewarding member riders for their loyalty by offering exclusive benefits, rewards programs, or discounts for frequent usage. Also, implementing personalized marketing strategies to engage member riders, such as targeted email campaigns with personalized recommendations based on their ride history and preferences.

- Optimized Station Placement and Infrastructure:

Investing in strategic station placement and infrastructure upgrades in high-traffic areas such as Streeter Dr and Grand Ave station, Lake Shore Dr & Monroe St, and Millennium Park to meet the demand of casual riders. And conducting thorough analyses of rider patterns and station utilization to identify opportunities for station expansion, relocation, or optimization to better serve customer needs and maximize profitability.

- Partnerships and Collaborations:

Exploring partnerships with local businesses, events, or attractions near popular bike stations to offer integrated services or joint promotional offers, enhancing the overall rider experience and attracting more customers. Also collaborating with city governments or transportation authorities to promote bike sharing as a sustainable and convenient transportation option, potentially securing funding or support for expansion initiatives.
